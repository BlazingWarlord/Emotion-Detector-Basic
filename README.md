# Emotion-Detector-Basic
A Basic, Slightly Inaccurate Emotion Detector

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer

This emotion detector with Tensorflow and OpenCV detects your face and tries to predict your emotion. I used only happy, sad, and neutral and used only 1000 images per class due to computer specifications but feel free to use all images and tinker with values to improve accuracy (this could be more accurate).
